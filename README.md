# Hi üëã My name is Askhat!
==============================================================================================================================  


### üôå Welcome!  
I'm a Junior Data Analyst. I have my own project where I analyze different metrics for anicinema and offer solutions to increase its profitability. I make dashboards and I can create unit calculators. 

I chose data analytics because all my life I had to make decisions in different areas of life, and for this I had to think critically and analyze. So, I want to continue to do this in my professional life and I think it's good for me. 

I value sharing knowledge and staying up-to-date with technology. I use online resources to improve my Hard Skills such as Leetcode, Stepik and etc. Also, I subscribed to my colleagues on YouTube to learn from their experience and my development accelerated. 

* üåç  I'm based in Bishkek and I want to move to another country in the future.
* üòé I like to learn new tools for analysis, f.e., now I'm studying Python and Power BI.

## üèÜ Projects

### Project1Ô∏è‚É£: Online store visualization
#### Tasks:
<ol>
  <li>Display complete sales and profit data</li>
  <li>What are the sales by categories and sub-categories?</li>
  <li>Display the most profitable and unprofitable sub-categories</li>
  <li>It should be possible to see statistics for a specific product</li>
</ol>

#### How did I decide: 
<p> I imported data into Tableau using SQL. Then, based on the data, I created several tables in Tableau to address the specified requirements. Finally, I merged them into one interactive dashboard.<p>

> <a href="https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/askhat.narkulov/viz/Productanalysis_16835638341140/Dashboard1?publish=yes">üîóProject link</a>

#### Conclusions (summary): This visualization displays complete sales and profit data for all cities.
<ol>
<p>‚óâ The data can be viewed in a segment dimension, product category, by product itself, and broken down by any date range.<p>
<p>‚óâ Anybody can see the following information in the dashboard:<p>
<p>‚û§‚û§ What are sales by categories and sub-categories?<p>
<p>‚û§‚û§ The most profitable and unprofitable categories, products and etc.<p>
<p>‚û§‚û§ It should be possible to see statistics for a specific product<p>
</ol>

### Project2Ô∏è‚É£: FOXY - anti-cinema startup 
#### What I had: 
<p> My cousin has a startup called FOXY, which is an anti-cinema. When I first visited there, I noticed that the staff was using a calculator on their phones for calculations with customers and recording reservations in a notebook. I offered my help to automate the process, speed up their work, and provide convenience in managing reservations.

We concluded that creating a Google spreadsheet would be a good idea because I could work remotely if needed. Additionally, it is convenient for the directors as they can access it from any device using a link.

After learning the pricing for services and promotions (pricing varies on weekdays/weekends, before 6 PM/after 6 PM, etc.), as well as the employees' preferences, I began working on the project.<p>
 
#### Tasks:
<ol>
  <li>Create a Google spreadsheet for managing calculations, reservations, further analysis, and automating the process, taking into account feedback from the staff</li>
  <li>Train the staff to use the spreadsheet</li>
  <li>Conduct a profitability analysis of the business every week/month, create dashboards, and provide directors with information along with my observations</li>
</ol>

#### How did I decide: 
<p> To begin with, I added important columns for calculating room fees, start time, and end time. Then, I included a column for additional sales (popcorn, drinks, etc.) so that the staff would have the complete payment amount. I added a weekday/weekend variation to calculate based on the current pricing. Lastly, I added columns for the customer's name, phone number, and so on.
The next step was to train the staff and continue the project.<p>

<p> ‚ùó HERE IS A TRUNCATED COPY OF THE PROJECT FOR YOUR REFERENCE <p>


#### Conclusions (summary):
<ol>
<p>‚óâ Now that I have completed the project, every week I export the data to Excel, clean it, filter it, and structure it for analysis. After that, I import this Excel file into Tableau and begin creating a dashboard.<p>
<p>‚óâ Automated the process, thereby speeding up the workflow for the employees, organizing the data, and reducing the risk of errors due to human factors.<p>
